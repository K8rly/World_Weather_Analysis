# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to use weather data to showcase potential vacation destinations for PlanMyTrip app testers and eventually users. Testers will be able to input preferred temperatures in order to identify possible vacation destinations and nearby hotel accomodations. The testers will also be able to create a travel itinerary and potential routes for their preferred cities, while seeing the current weather conditions for each location. 

The data is visualized with pop-up markers on a map to better display the potential vacation spots. Once these changes are incorporated into the PlanMyTrip app users will have a better view of hotel accomodations, travel routes, and current weather conditions for their potential vacation destinations.
